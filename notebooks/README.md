## Project Overview: TikTok Engagement Analysis

For clarity and organization, the analysis has been split into two separate Jupyter notebooks:

### 1. `unsupervised_learning_eda.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using unsupervised learning techniques. The primary objectives of this notebook are:
- To explore the structure of the dataset.
- To visualize and analyze the engagement metrics and user interactions on the TikTok platform.
- To test the effects of different engagement metrics.

### 2. `unsupervised_learning_models.ipynb`
This notebook covers the machine learning models and analysis methods that complement the EDA:
- Implementation of classification and logistic regression machine learning models.
- Fine-tuning of the models and performance evaluation.
- Further insights derived from the processed data.
