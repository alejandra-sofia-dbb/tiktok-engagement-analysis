## Project Overview: TikTok Engagement Analysis

For clarity and organization, the analysis has been split into two separate Jupyter notebooks:

### 1. `unsupervised_learning_eda.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using unsupervised learning techniques. The primary objectives of this notebook are:
- To explore the structure of the dataset.
- To visualize and analyze the engagement metrics and user interactions on the TikTok platform.
- To test the effects of different engagement metrics.

### 2. `unsupervised_learning_models.ipynb`
This notebook covers the machine learning models and analysis methods that complement the EDA:
- Implementation of classification and logistic regression machine learning models.
- Fine-tuning of the models and performance evaluation.
- Further insights derived from the processed data.

### Why Two Notebooks?
Splitting the project into these two notebooks helps maintain clarity by separating the exploratory phase of the analysis from the machine learning modeling phase. This structure also allows for easier scalability if additional techniques or models need to be applied in the future.

Feel free to explore both notebooks to gain a complete understanding of the analysis workflow!
